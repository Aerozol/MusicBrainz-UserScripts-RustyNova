# Rustynova's musicbrainz userscript collection

Here's a bunch of userscripts I made/forked. Feel free to use them!

# Spotify:
## Import
This userscript adds two buttons on the album pages to search the release in Musicbrainz/Open it if the URL is present, or a button to go directly to Atisket

## Status
This userscript add a border arround all the album cards when it cannot find the album URL in MusicBrainz, allowing quick reference on what's left to add

️⚠️ This doesn't mean the release isn't in MB. It only means the release doesn't have a spotify URL attached to it ⚠️
